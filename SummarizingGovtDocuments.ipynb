      " Summarize: Congress may want to consider requiring the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to report on the results of the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA) efforts to identify and prevent unnecessary duplication within and across its preparedness grant programs and to consider these results when making future funding decisions for these programs. Once FEMA has completed its assessment, Congress may wish to consider limiting the use of federal preparedness grant programs to fund only projects to fill identified, validated, and documented capability gaps that may (or may not) include maintaining existing capabilities developed. Partially Addressed: In March 2011, GAO reported that FEMA had not completed efforts to develop and implement a comprehensive and measurable national preparedness assessment of capability and gaps. At that time, GAO suggested that Congress consider limiting preparedness grant funding until FEMA completes a national preparedness assessment of capability gaps at each level based on tiered, capability-specific performance objectives to enable prioritization of grant funding. The House committee report accompanying the DHS appropriations bill for fiscal year 2012 stated that FEMA could not demonstrate how the use of the grants had enhanced disaster preparedness. In March 2012 testimony, GAO reported on the importance of establishing such a framework. As of June 2021, no further legislative action limiting the use of preparedness grants had been identified. FEMA has made progress in completing a national preparedness assessment for state and local jurisdictions. In 2018, FEMA required jurisdictions to begin using the new methodology to establish standard quantitative capability targets and assess core capabilities within the response and recovery mission areas. In 2019, FEMA continued with its implementation and required jurisdictions to establish standard capability targets for capabilities in the prevention, protection, and mitigation mission areas. In addition, in 2019, FEMA initiated an effort to assess the federal government's emergency management capacity and issued its 2019 National Threat and Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment (National THIRA): Overview and Methodology. The report described FEMA’s approach to completing a national-level risk assessment (i.e., a National THIRA), which will be included in FEMA’s 2021 National Preparedness Report. Until FEMA implements its new methodology and begins to more fully assess both federal and jurisdictional capabilities, FEMA will not have a basis to operationalize and implement its conceptual approach for assessing federal, state, and local preparedness.\n"

At that time, GAO suggested that Congress consider limiting preparedness grant funding until FEMA completes a national preparedness assessment of capability gaps at each level based on tiered, capability-specific performance objectives to enable prioritization of grant funding. The House committee report accompanying the DHS appropriations bill for fiscal year 2012 stated that FEMA could not demonstrate how the use of the grants had enhanced disaster preparedness. In March 2012 testimony, GAO reported on the importance of establishing such a framework. As of June 2021, no further legislative action limiting the use of preparedness grants had been identified.\n",
    "FEMA has made progress in completing a national preparedness assessment for state and local jurisdictions. In 2018, FEMA required jurisdictions to begin using the new methodology to establish standard quantitative capability targets and assess core capabilities within the response and recovery mission areas. In 2019, FEMA continued with its implementation and required jurisdictions to establish standard capability targets for capabilities in the prevention, protection, and mitigation mission areas. In addition, in 2019, FEMA initiated an effort to assess the federal government's emergency management capacity and issued its 2019 National Threat and Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment (National THIRA): Overview and Methodology. The report described FEMA’s approach to completing a national-level risk assessment (i.e., a National THIRA), which will be included in FEMA’s 2021 National Preparedness Report. Until FEMA implements its new methodology and begins to more fully assess both federal and jurisdictional capabilities, FEMA will not have a basis to operationalize and implement its conceptual approach for assessing federal, state, and local preparedness.\"\"\", 100)"

This problem is compounded with  ineffective communication among the federal, state, and local  governments that has resulted in untimely, disparate, and at times  conflicting communication between those who need it most. DHS has been  given a primary role in providing cross-sector coordination to improve  communication and planning efforts and serves as the single point of  coordination for state and local governments on homeland security  issues. To fulfill its role as the cross-sector coordinator, DHS will  partner with state and local governments and the private sector to  institute processes that are transparent, comprehensive, and results- oriented.

Also, while all five reported that they served as the  clearinghouse of information (such as incident reports and warnings  received from members) for their own sectors, only three of the five  reported that they are also coordinating with other sectors.

These restrictions include exemption from  disclosure under FOIA, a general limitation on use to CIP purposes, and  limitations on use in civil actions and by state or local governments.

For  example, the FBI reported it had significantly increased the number of  its Joint Terrorism Task Forces and, according to our survey, 34 of 40  states and 160 of 228 cities stated that they participated in  information-sharing centers. However, although such initiatives may  increase the sharing of information to fight terrorism, none of the  three levels of government perceived the current information-sharing  process as effective, particularly when sharing information with  federal agencies. Respondents reported that information on threats,  methods, and techniques of terrorists was not routinely shared; and the  information that was shared was not perceived as timely, accurate, or  relevant. Further, 30 of 40 states and 212 of 228 cities responded that  they were not given the opportunity to participate in national policy  making on information sharing.

Similarly, in developing a vulnerability  assessment methodology to assess the security of chemical facilities  against terrorist and criminal attacks, the Department of Justice  observed that chemical facilities need more specific information about  potential threats in order to design their security systems and  protocols. Chemical industry officials also noted that efforts to share  threat information among industry and federal agencies will be  effective only if government agencies provide specific and accurate  threat information. Threat information also forms the foundation for  some of the tools available to industry for assessing facility  vulnerabilities. The Justice vulnerability assessment methodology  requires threat information as the foundation for hypothesizing about  threat scenarios, which form the basis for determining site  vulnerabilities\n",

    "in recent years, establishing the trusted relationships and \n",
    "information-sharing protocols necessary to support such coordination \n",
    "can be difficult. In addition, the private sector has expressed \n",

    "difficulty of obtaining security clearances. Both the Congress and the \n",
    "administration have taken steps to address information sharing issues \n",
    "in law and recent policy guidance, but their effectiveness will largely \n",
    "depend on how DHS implements its information sharing responsibilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "A number of activities have been undertaken to build information-\n",
    "sharing relationships between the federal government and the private \n",
    "sector, such as InfraGard, the Partnership for Critical Infrastructure \n",
    "Security, efforts by the CIAO, and efforts by lead agencies to \n",
    "establish ISACs. For example, the InfraGard Program, which provides the \n",
    "FBI and NIPC with a means of securely sharing information with \n",
    "individual companies, has expanded substantially. InfraGard membership \n",
    "has increased from 277 in October 2000 to almost 9,400 in September \n",
    "2003. Members include representatives from private industry, other \n",
    "government agencies, state and local law enforcement, and the academic \n",
    "community.\n",
    "\n",
    "As stated above, PDD 63 encouraged the voluntary creation of ISACs to \n",
    "serve as the mechanism for gathering, analyzing, and appropriately \n",
    "sanitizing and disseminating information between the private sector and \n",
    "the federal government through NIPC. In April 2001, we reported that \n",
    "NIPC and other government entities had not developed fully productive \n",
    "information-sharing relationships but that NIPC had undertaken a range \n",
    "of initiatives to foster information-sharing relationships with ISACs, \n",
    "as well as with government and international entities. We recommended \n",
    "that NIPC formalize relationships with ISACs and develop a plan to \n",
    "foster a two-way exchange of information between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "In response to our recommendations, NIPC officials told us in July 2002 \n",
    "that an ISAC development and support unit had been created, whose \n",
    "mission was to enhance private-sector cooperation and trust so that it \n",
    "would result in a two-way sharing of information. As shown previously \n",
    "in table 3, as of April 2003, DHS reported that there are 16 current \n",
    "ISACs, including ISACs established for sectors not identified as \n",
    "critical infrastructure sectors. DHS officials also stated that they \n",
    "have formal agreements with most of the current ISACs.\n",
    "\n",
    "In spite of progress made in establishing ISACs, additional efforts are \n",
    "needed. All sectors do not have a fully established ISAC, and even for \n",
    "those sectors that do, our recent work showed that participation may be \n",
    "mixed, and the amount of information being shared between the federal \n",
    "government and private-sector organizations also varies. Specifically, \n",
    "as we reported in February 2003, the five ISACs we recently reviewed \n",
    "showed different levels of progress in implementing the PDD 63 \n",
    "suggested activities.[Footnote 19] For example, four of the five \n",
    "reported that efforts were still in progress to establish baseline \n",
    "statistics, which includes developing a database on the normal levels \n",
    "of computer security incidents that would be used for analysis \n",
    "purposes. Also, while all five reported that they served as the \n",
    "clearinghouse of information (such as incident reports and warnings \n",
    "received from members) for their own sectors, only three of the five \n",
    "reported that they are also coordinating with other sectors. Only one \n",
    "of the five ISACs reported that it provides a library of incidents and \n",
    "historical data that was available to both the private sector and the \n",
    "federal government, and although three additional ISACs do maintain a \n",
    "library, it was available only to the private sector. Table 4 \n",
    "summarizes the reported status of the five ISACs in performing these \n",
    "and other activities suggested by PDD 63.\n",
    "\n",
    "As also noted in our February 2003 report, some in the private sector \n",
    "expressed concerns about voluntarily sharing information with the \n",
    "government. Specifically, concerns were raised that industry could \n",
    "potentially face antitrust violations for sharing information with \n",
    "other industry partners, have their information subject to the Freedom \n",
    "of Information Act (FOIA), or face potential liability concerns for \n",
    "information shared in good faith. For example, the IT, energy, and the \n",
    "water ISACs reported that they did not share their libraries with the \n",
    "federal government because of concerns that information could be \n",
    "released under FOIA. And, officials of the energy ISAC stated that they \n",
    "have not reported incidents to NIPC because of FOIA and antitrust \n",
    "concerns.\n",
    "\n",
    "The recently established ISAC Council may help to address some of these \n",
    "concerns. According to its chairman, the mission of the ISAC Council is \n",
    "to advance the physical and cybersecurity of the critical \n",
    "infrastructures of North America by establishing and maintaining a \n",
    "framework for interaction between and among the ISACs. Activities of \n",
    "the council include establishing and maintaining a policy for inter-\n",
    "ISAC coordination, a dialog with governmental agencies that deal with \n",
    "ISACs, and a practical data and information sharing protocol (what to \n",
    "share and how to share). In addition, the council will develop \n",
    "analytical methods to assist the ISACs in supporting their own sectors \n",
    "and other sectors with which there are interdependencies and establish \n",
    "a policy to deal with matters of liability and anti-trust. The chairman \n",
    "also reported that the council held an initial meeting with DHS and the \n",
    "White House in June 2003 to, among other things, understand mutual DHS \n",
    "and ISAC expectations.\n",
    "\n",
    "There will be continuing debate as to whether adequate protection is \n",
    "being provided to the private sector as these entities are encouraged \n",
    "to disclose and exchange information on both physical and cybersecurity \n",
    "problems and solutions that are essential to protecting our nation's \n",
    "critical infrastructures. The National Strategy for Homeland Security \n",
    "includes \"enabling critical infrastructure information sharing\" in its \n",
    "12 major legislative initiatives. It states that the nation must meet \n",
    "this need by narrowly limiting public disclosure of information \n",
    "relevant to protecting our physical and cyber critical infrastructures \n",
    "in order to facilitate the voluntary submission of information. It \n",
    "further states that the Attorney General will convene a panel to \n",
    "propose any legal changes necessary to enable sharing of essential \n",
    "homeland security related information between the federal government \n",
    "and the private sector.\n",
    "\n",
    "Actions have already been taken by the Congress and the administration \n",
    "to strengthen information sharing. For example, the USA PATRIOT Act \n",
    "promotes information sharing among federal agencies, and numerous \n",
    "terrorism task forces have been established to coordinate \n",
    "investigations and improve communications among federal and local law \n",
    "enforcement.[Footnote 20] Moreover, the Homeland Security Act of 2002 \n",
    "includes provisions that restrict federal, state, and local government \n",
    "use and disclosure of critical infrastructure information that has been \n",
    "voluntarily submitted to DHS. These restrictions include exemption from \n",
    "disclosure under FOIA, a general limitation on use to CIP purposes, and \n",
    "limitations on use in civil actions and by state or local governments. \n",
    "The act also provides penalties for any federal employee who improperly \n",
    "discloses any protected critical infrastructure information. In April \n",
    "2003, DHS issued for comment its proposed rules for how critical \n",
    "infrastructure information volunteered by the public will be protected. \n",
    "At this time, it is too early to tell what impact the act will have on \n",
    "the willingness of the private sector to share critical infrastructure \n",
    "information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Information sharing among federal, state and local governments also \n",
    "needs to be improved. In August 2003 we reported the results of our \n",
    "survey of federal, state, and city government officials' perceptions of \n",
    "the effectiveness of the current information-sharing process.[Footnote \n",
    "21] Performed primarily before DHS began its operations, our survey \n",
    "identified some notable information-sharing initiatives, but also \n",
    "highlighted coordination issues and other concerns that many of the \n",
    "surveyed entities had with the overall information-sharing process. For \n",
    "example, the FBI reported it had significantly increased the number of \n",
    "its Joint Terrorism Task Forces and, according to our survey, 34 of 40 \n",
    "states and 160 of 228 cities stated that they participated in \n",
    "information-sharing centers. However, although such initiatives may \n",
    "increase the sharing of information to fight terrorism, none of the \n",
    "three levels of government perceived the current information-sharing \n",
    "process as effective, particularly when sharing information with \n",
    "federal agencies. Respondents reported that information on threats, \n",
    "methods, and techniques of terrorists was not routinely shared; and the \n",
    "information that was shared was not perceived as timely, accurate, or \n",
    "relevant. Further, 30 of 40 states and 212 of 228 cities responded that \n",
    "they were not given the opportunity to participate in national policy \n",
    "making on information sharing. Federal agencies in our survey also \n",
    "identified several barriers to sharing threat information with state \n",
    "and city governments, including the inability of state and city \n",
    "officials to secure and protect classified information, the lack of \n",
    "federal security clearances, and a lack of integrated databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "The private sector has also expressed its concerns about the value of \n",
    "information being provided by the government. For example, in July 2002 \n",
    "the President for the Partnership for Critical Infrastructure Security \n",
    "stated in congressional testimony that information sharing between the \n",
    "government and private sector needs work, specifically, in the quality \n",
    "and timeliness of cybersecurity information coming from the \n",
    "government.[Footnote 22] In March 2003 we also reported that the \n",
    "officials from the chemical industry noted that they need better threat \n",
    "information from law enforcement agencies, as well as better \n",
    "coordination among agencies providing threat information.[Footnote 23] \n",
    "They stated that chemical companies do not receive enough specific \n",
    "threat information and that it frequently comes from multiple \n",
    "government agencies. Similarly, in developing a vulnerability \n",
    "assessment methodology to assess the security of chemical facilities \n",
    "against terrorist and criminal attacks, the Department of Justice \n",
    "observed that chemical facilities need more specific information about \n",
    "potential threats in order to design their security systems and \n",
    "protocols. Chemical industry officials also noted that efforts to share \n",
    "threat information among industry and federal agencies will be \n",
    "effective only if government agencies provide specific and accurate \n",
    "threat information. Threat information also forms the foundation for \n",
    "some of the tools available to industry for assessing facility \n",
    "vulnerabilities. The Justice vulnerability assessment methodology \n",
    "requires threat information as the foundation for hypothesizing about \n",
    "threat scenarios, which form the basis for determining site \n",
    "vulnerabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Homeland Security Act, the National Strategy for Homeland Security, \n",
    "the National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace, and the National Strategy \n",
    "for the Physical Protection of Critical Infrastructures and Key Assets \n",
    "all acknowledge the importance of information sharing and identify \n",

    "Analysis and warning capabilities should be developed to detect \n",
    "precursors to attacks on the nation so that advanced warnings can be \n",
    "issued and protective measures implemented. Since the 1990s, the \n",
    "national security community and the Congress have identified the need \n",
    "to establish analysis and warning capabilities to protect against \n",
    "strategic computer attacks against the nation's critical computer-\n",
    "dependent infrastructures. Such capabilities need to address both cyber \n",
    "and physical threats and involve (1) gathering and analyzing \n",
    "information for the purpose of detecting and reporting otherwise \n",
    "potentially damaging actions or intentions and (2) implementing a \n",
    "process for warning policymakers and allowing them time to determine \n",
    "the magnitude of the related risks.\n",
    "\n",
    "In April 2001,[Footnote 24] we reported on NIPC's progress and \n",
    "impediments in developing analysis and warning capabilities for \n",
    "computer-based attacks, which included the following:[Footnote 25]\n",
    "\n",
    "* Lack of a generally accepted methodology for analyzing strategic \n",
    "cyber-based threats. For example, there was no standard terminology, no \n",
    "standard set of factors to consider, and no established thresholds for \n",
    "determining the sophistication of attack techniques. According to \n",
    "officials in the intelligence and national security community, \n",
    "developing such a methodology would require an intense interagency \n",
    "effort and dedication of resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Lack of industry-specific data on factors such as critical system \n",
    "components, known vulnerabilities, and interdependencies. Under PDD 63, \n",
    "such information is to be developed for each of eight industry segments \n",
    "by industry representatives and the designated federal lead agencies. \n",
    "In September 2001, we reported that although outreach efforts had \n",
    "raised awareness and improved information sharing, substantive, \n",
    "comprehensive analysis of infrastructure sector interdependencies and \n",
    "vulnerabilities had been limited.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another challenge confronting the analysis and warning capabilities of \n",
    "our nation is that, historically, our national CIP attention and \n",
    "efforts have been focused on cyber threats. As we also reported in \n",
    "April 2001, although PDD 63 covers both physical and cyber threats, \n",
    "federal efforts to meet the directive's requirements have pertained \n",
    "primarily to cyber threats since this is an area that the leaders of \n",
    "the administration's CIP strategy view as needing attention. However, \n",
    "the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, have increased the \n",
    "emphasis of physical threats. In addition, in July 2002, NIPC reported \n",
    "that the potential for concurrent cyber and physical (\"swarming\") \n",
    "attacks is an emerging threat to the U.S. critical infrastructure. \n",
    "Further, in July 2002, the director of NIPC also told us that NIPC had \n",
    "begun to develop some capabilities for identifying physical CIP \n",
    "threats. For example, NIPC had developed thresholds with several ISACs \n",
    "for reporting physical incidents and, since January 2002, has issued \n",
    "several information bulletins concerning physical CIP threats. However, \n",
    "NIPC's director acknowledged that fully developing this capability \n",
    "would be a significant challenge. The physical protection strategy \n",
    "states that DHS will maintain a comprehensive, up-to-date assessment of \n",
    "vulnerabilities across sectors and improve processes for domestic \n",
    "threat data collection, analysis, and dissemination to state and local \n",
    "governments and private industry.\n",
    "\n",
    "The administration and the Congress continue to emphasize the need for \n",
    "these analysis and warning capabilities. The National Strategy for \n",
    "Homeland Security identified intelligence and warning as one of six \n",
    "critical mission areas and called for major initiatives to improve our \n",
    "nation's analysis and warning capabilities. The strategy also stated \n",
    "that no government entity was then responsible for analyzing terrorist \n",
    "threats to the homeland, mapping these threats to our vulnerabilities, \n",
    "and taking protective action. The Homeland Security Act gives such \n",
    "responsibility to the new DHS. For example, the IAIP Under Secretary is \n",
    "responsible for administering the Homeland Security Advisory System, \n",
    "and is to coordinate with other federal agencies to provide specific \n",
    "warning information and advice to state and local agencies, the private \n",
    "sector, the public, and other entities about appropriate protective \n",
    "measures and countermeasures to homeland security threats.\n",
    "\n",
    "An important aspect of improving our nation's analysis and warning \n",
    "capabilities is having comprehensive vulnerability assessments. The \n",
    "National Strategy for Homeland Security also states that comprehensive \n",
    "vulnerability assessments of all of our nation's critical \n",
    "infrastructures are important from a planning perspective in that they \n",
    "enable authorities to evaluate the potential effects of an attack on a \n",
    "given sector and then invest accordingly to protect it. The strategy \n",
    "states that the U.S. government does not perform vulnerability \n",
    "assessments of the nation's entire critical infrastructure. The \n",
    "Homeland Security Act of 2002 states that the DHS's IAIP Under \n",
    "Secretary is to carry out comprehensive assessments of the \n",
    "vulnerabilities of key resources and critical infrastructures of the \n",
    "United States.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another critical issue in developing effective analysis and warning \n",
    "capabilities is to ensure that appropriate intelligence and other \n",
    "threat information, both cyber and physical, is received from the \n",
    "intelligence and law enforcement communities. For example, there has \n",
    "been considerable public debate regarding the quality and timeliness of \n",
    "intelligence data shared between and among relevant intelligence, law \n",
    "enforcement, and other agencies. Also, as the transfer of NIPC to DHS \n",
    "organizationally separated it from the FBI's law enforcement activities \n",
    "(including the Counterterrorism Division and NIPC field agents), it \n",
    "will be critical to establish mechanisms for continued communication to \n",
    "occur. Further, it will be important that the relationships between the \n",
    "law enforcement and intelligence communities and the new DHS are \n",
    "effective and that appropriate information is exchanged on a timely \n",
    "basis. The act gives DHS broad statutory authority to access \n",
    "intelligence information, as well as other information relevant to the \n",
    "terrorist threat and to turn this information into useful warnings. For \n",
    "example, DHS is to be a key participant in the multiagency \n",
    "TTIC[Footnote 26] that began operations on May 1, 2003. According to a \n",
    "White House fact sheet, DHS's IAIP is to receive and analyze terrorism-\n",
    "related information from the TTIC.[Footnote 27] Although the purpose of \n",
    "TTIC and the authorities and responsibilities of the FBI and Central \n",
    "Intelligence Agency (CIA) counterterrorism organizations remain \n",
    "distinct, in July 2003, the TTIC Director reported that initiatives are \n",
    "under way to facilitate efforts within the intelligence community to \n",
    "ensure that DHS has access to all information required to execute its \n",
    "mission. He also reported other progress, such as updates to a TTIC-\n",
    "sponsored Web site that provides terrorism-related information. For \n",
    "example, the Web site is to increasingly include products tailored to \n",
    "the needs of state and local officials, as well as private industry.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, according to NIPC's director, as of July 2002, a \n",
    "significant challenge in developing a robust analysis and warning \n",
    "function is the development of the technology and human capital \n",
    "capacities to collect and analyze substantial amounts of information. \n",
    "Similarly, the Director of the FBI testified in June 2002 that \n",
    "implementing a more proactive approach to preventing terrorist acts and \n",
    "denying terrorist groups the ability to operate and raise funds require \n",
    "a centralized and robust analytical capacity that did not then exist in \n",
    "the FBI's Counterterrorism Division.[Footnote 28] He also stated that \n",
    "processing and exploiting information gathered domestically and abroad \n",
    "during the course of investigations require an enhanced analytical and \n",
    "data mining capacity that was not then available. According to DHS's \n",
    "reorganization plans, the IAIP Under Secretary and the chief \n",
    "information officer (CIO) of the department are to fulfill their \n",
    "responsibilities as laid out by the act to establish and uses a secure \n",

      "Why GAO Did This Study:\n",
      "\n",
      "The Homeland Security Act of 2002, which created the Department of \n",
      "Homeland Security (DHS), brought together 22 diverse organizations to \n",
      "help prevent terrorist attacks in the United States, reduce the \n",
      "vulnerability of the United States to terrorist attacks, and minimize \n",
      "damage and assist in recovery from attacks that do occur. To \n",
      "accomplish this mission, the act established specific homeland \n",
      "security responsibilities for the department, which included sharing \n",
      "information among its own entities and with other federal agencies, \n",
      "state and local governments, the private sector, and others. \n",
      "\n",
      "GAO was asked to discuss the significance of information sharing in \n",
      "fulfilling DHS�s responsibilities, emphasizing GAO�s related prior \n",
      "analyses and recommendations for improving the federal government�s \n",
      "information sharing efforts.\n",
      "\n",
      "What GAO Found:\n",
      "\n",
      "DHS�s responsibilities include coordinating and sharing information \n",
      "related to threats of domestic terrorism within the department and \n",
      "with and between other federal agencies, state and local governments, \n",
      "the private sector, and other entities. To accomplish its missions, \n",
      "DHS must, for example, access, receive, and analyze law enforcement \n",
      "information, intelligence information, and other threat, incident, and \n",
      "vulnerability information from federal and nonfederal sources and \n",
      "analyze such information to identify and assess the nature and scope \n",
      "of terrorist threats. DHS must also share information both internally \n",
      "and externally with agencies and law enforcement on such things as \n",
      "goods and passengers inbound to the United States and individuals who \n",
      "are known or suspected terrorists and criminals.\n",
      "\n",
      "GAO has made numerous recommendations related to information sharing \n",
      "particularly as they relate to fulfilling DHS�s critical \n",
      "infrastructure protection responsibilities. Although improvements have \n",
      "been made, more efforts are needed to address the following \n",
      "challenges, among others, that GAO has identified:\n",
      "\n",
      "* developing a comprehensive and coordinated national plan to \n",
      "facilitate information sharing on critical infrastructure protection;\n",
      "* developing productive information sharing relationships between the \n",
      "federal government and state and local governments and the private \n",

      "information sharing with the federal government and enhance other \n",
      "critical infrastructure protection efforts. \n",
      "\n",
      "Through our prior work, we have identified critical success factors \n",
      "and other key management issues that DHS should consider as it \n",
      "establishes systems and processes to facilitate information sharing \n",
      "among and between government entities and the private sector. These \n",
      "success factors include establishing trust relationships with a wide \n",
      "variety of federal and nonfederal entities that may be in a position \n",
      "to provide potentially useful information and advice on \n",
      "vulnerabilities and incidents. Further, as part of its information \n",

      "lethal and capable of \n",
      "producing tens of thousands of casualties. They are also relatively \n",
      "easy to manufacture, using basic equipment, trained personnel, and \n",

      "that no government entity was then responsible for analyzing terrorist \n",
      "threats to the homeland, mapping these threats to our vulnerabilities, \n",

      "maintained by different federal agencies.[Footnote 32] These watch \n",
      "lists are important information-sharing tools for securing our nation's \n",
      "borders against terrorists. Simply stated, watch lists can be viewed as \n",

      "\n",
      "According to the National Strategy for Homeland Security, in the \n",
      "aftermath of the September 11th attacks, it became clear that vital \n",
      "watch list information stored in numerous and disparate databases was \n",
      "not available to the right people at the right time. In particular, \n",
      "federal agencies that maintained information about terrorists and other \n",

      "\n",
      "Success Factors for Sharing Information:\n",
      "\n",
      "In October 2001, we reported on information sharing practices of \n",
      "organizations that successfully share sensitive or time-critical \n",
      "information.[Footnote 35] We found that these practices include:\n",
      "\n",
      "* establishing trust relationships with a wide variety of federal and \n",

      "* taking steps to ensure that sensitive information is not \n",
      "inappropriately disseminated.\n",
      "\n",
      "Among the organizations we studied, we found some very good models to \n",
      "learn from and build on. For example, CERT/CC is charged with \n",
      "establishing a capability to quickly and effectively coordinate \n",
      "communication between experts in order to limit damage, responding to \n",
      "incidents, and building awareness of security issues across the \n",
      "Internet community. In this role, CERT/CC receives Internet security-\n",
      "related information from system and network administrators, technology \n",
      "managers, and policymakers and provides them with this information \n",
      "along with guidance and coordination to major security events. Further, \n",
      "the Agora is a Seattle-based regional network that at the time of our \n",
      "study had over 600 professionals representing various fields, including \n",
      "information systems security; law enforcement; local, state, and \n",
      "federal governments; engineering; IT; academics; and other specialties. \n",
      "Members work to establish confidential ways for organizations to share \n",
      "sensitive information about common problems and best practices for \n",
      "dealing with security threats. They develop and share knowledge about \n",
      "how to protect electronic infrastructures, and they prompt more \n",
      "research specific to electronic information systems security.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, we have previously reported on several other key \n",

      "including:\n",
      "\n",
      "* identifying and agreeing on the types of information to be collected \n",

      "* determining the right format and standards for collecting data so \n",
      "that disparate agencies can aggregate and integrate data sets.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some efforts have already taken place in these areas. For example, NIPC \n",
      "obtained information-sharing agreements with most ISACs, which included \n",
      "specific reporting thresholds for physical and cyber incidents. Also, \n",
      "incident reporting thresholds have been publicly issued. It will be \n",
      "important for DHS to incorporate these considerations into its \n",
      "information-sharing efforts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Developing Technological Solutions:\n",
      "\n",
      "Developing and implementing appropriate technological solutions can \n",
      "improve the effectiveness and efficiency of information sharing. We \n",
      "have previously reported on the lack of connectivity and \n",
      "interoperability between databases and technologies important to the \n",
      "homeland security effort.[Footnote 36] Databases belonging to federal \n",
      "law enforcement agencies and INS, for example, are not connected, and \n",
      "databases between state, local, and federal governments are not always \n",
      "connected. The technological constraints caused by different system \n",
      "architectures that impede the sharing of different agencies' watch \n",
      "lists illustrate the widespread lack of interoperability of many \n",
      "federal government information systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "New technologies for data integration and interoperability could enable \n",
      "agencies to share information without the need for radical structural \n",
      "changes. This would allow the component agencies of DHS to work \n",
      "together yet retain a measure of autonomy, thus removing some barriers \n",
      "hindering agencies from embracing change. In August 2002, we reported \n",
      "on various existing technologies that could be more widely implemented \n",
      "to facilitate information sharing.[Footnote 37] We reported that \n",
      "Extensible Markup Language (XML) is useful for better information \n",
      "sharing. XML is a flexible, nonproprietary set of standards for \n",
      "annotating or \"tagging\" information so that it can be transmitted over \n",
      "a network such as the Internet and readily interpreted by disparate \n",
      "computer systems. If implemented broadly with consistent data \n",
      "definitions and structures, XML offers the promise of making it \n",
      "significantly easier for organizations and individuals to identify, \n",
      "integrate, and process information that may be widely dispersed among \n",
      "systems and organizations. For example, law enforcement agencies could \n",
      "potentially better identify and retrieve information about criminal \n",
      "suspects from any number of federal, state, and local databases.\n",
      "\n",
      "We also reported that various technologies could be used to protect \n",
      "information in shared databases. For example, data could be protected \n",
      "through electronically secured entry technology (ESET). ESET would \n",
      "allow users of separate databases to cross check or \"mine\" data \n",
      "securely without directly disclosing their information to others, thus \n",
      "allowing agencies to collaborate as well as address their needs for \n",
      "confidentiality or privacy. Such technology could, for example, allow \n",
      "an airline to cross check a passenger or employee against data held by \n",
      "government agencies in a single-step process without actually \n",
      "disclosing the data to the airline. In checking an individual, the \n",
      "airline would not receive any data from the agencies' databases; \n",
      "rather, it would receive a \"yes or no\" type of response and/or a \n",
      "referral for further action. Additionally, appropriate authorities \n",
      "could automatically be notified.\n",
      "\n",
      "We noted that intrusion detection systems could be used to prevent \n",
      "unauthorized users from accessing shared information. Intrusion \n",
      "detection uses normal system and network activity data as well as known \n",
      "attack patterns. Deviations from normal traffic patterns can help to \n",
      "identify potential intruders.\n",
      "\n",
      "We also observed the need to simplify the process of analyzing \n",
      "information to more efficiently and effectively identify information of \n",
      "consequence that must be shared. Great emphasis has been placed upon \n",
      "data mining and data integration, but the third and perhaps most \n",
      "crucial component may be data visualization. The vast amount of \n",
      "information potentially available to be mined and integrated must be \n",
      "intelligently analyzed, and the results effectively presented, so that \n",
      "the right people have the right information necessary to act \n",
      "effectively upon such information. This may involve pinpointing the \n",
      "relevant anomalies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before DHS was established, the Office of Homeland Security had already \n",
      "begun several technological initiatives to integrate terrorist-related \n",
      "information from databases from different agencies responsible for \n",
      "homeland security. These included (1) adopting meta-data standards for \n",
      "electronic information so that homeland security officials understood \n",

      "the development of goals, milestones, and metrics to measure progress \n",
      "and success, and such indicators should be clearly articulated and \n",
      "endorsed by senior management. Such goals and metrics must be carefully \n",

      "Emphasizing Human Capital:\n",
      "\n",
      "Human capital is another critical ingredient required for ensuring \n",
      "successful information sharing for homeland security. The cornerstones \n",
      "to effective human capital planning include leadership; strategic human \n",
      "capital planning; acquiring, developing, and retaining talent; and \n",
      "building results-oriented organizational cultures. The homeland \n",
      "security and intelligence communities must include these factors in \n",
      "their management approach in order to benefit from effective \n",
      "collaboration in this critical time.\n",
      "\n",
      "As we have previously reported, the governmentwide increase in homeland \n",
      "security activities has created a demand for personnel with skills in \n",
      "areas such as IT, foreign language proficiencies, and law enforcement, \n",
      "without whom critical information has less chance of being shared, \n",
      "analyzed, integrated, and disseminated in a timely, effective \n",
      "manner.[Footnote 59] We specifically reported that shortages in \n",
      "staffing at some agencies had exacerbated backlogs in intelligence and \n",
      "other information, adversely affecting agency operations and hindering \n",
      "U.S. military, law enforcement, intelligence, counterterrorism, and \n",
      "diplomatic efforts.[Footnote 60]\n",
      "\n",
      "We have also previously reported that some of the agencies that moved \n",
      "into DHS have long-standing human capital problems that will need to be \n",
      "addressed. One of these challenges has been the ability to hire and \n",
      "retain a talented and motivated staff. For example, we reported that \n",
      "INS has been unable to reach its program goals in large part because of \n",
      "such staffing problems as hiring shortfalls and agent \n",
      "attrition.[Footnote 61] We also reported that several INS functions \n",
      "have been affected by the lack of a staff resource allocation model to \n",
      "identify staffing needs.[Footnote 62] We concluded then that it was \n",
      "likely that increased attention to the enforcement of immigration laws \n",
      "and border control would test the capacity of DHS to hire large numbers \n",
      "of inspectors for work at our nation's border entry points. Moreover, \n",
      "we reported that other agencies being integrated into DHS were also \n",
      "expected to experience challenges in hiring security workers and \n",
      "inspectors. For example, we reported that the Agriculture Department, \n",
      "the Customs Service, INS, and other agencies were all simultaneously \n",
      "seeking to increase the size of their inspections staffs.[Footnote 63]\n",
      "\n",
      "To overcome its significant human capital shortfalls, DHS must develop \n",
      "a comprehensive strategy capable of ensuring that the new department \n",
      "can acquire, develop, and retain the skills and talents needed to \n",
      "prevent and protect against terrorism. This requires identifying skill \n",
      "needs; attracting people with scarce skills into government jobs; \n",
      "melding diverse compensation systems to support the new department's \n",
      "many needs; and establishing a performance-oriented, accountable \n",
      "culture that promotes employee involvement and empowerment. In \n",
      "February, the DHS CIO acknowledged the lack of properly skilled IT \n",
      "staff within the component agencies. Challenges facing DHS in this \n",
      "area, he stated, include overcoming political and cultural barriers, \n",
      "leveraging cultural beliefs and diversity to achieve collaborative \n",
      "change, and recruiting and retaining skilled IT workers. He \n",
      "acknowledged that the department would have to evaluate the talent and \n",
      "skills of its IT workforce to identify existing skill gaps. He further \n",
      "stated that a critical component of DHS's IT strategic plan would \n",
      "address the actions needed to train, reskill, or acquire the necessary \n",
      "skills to achieve a world-class workforce. He committed to working \n",
      "closely with the department's Chief Human Capital Officer and with the \n",
      "Office of Personnel Management to achieve this goal. He set July 2003 \n",
      "as a milestone for developing a current inventory of IT skills, \n",
